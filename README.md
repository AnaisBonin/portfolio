# Welcome! / Bienvenue !

As a developer, it seemed to me quite obvious to start with creating a portfolio - in order to present myself a little bit and show a few skills I developed over the years. 

I use Javascript React and Node JS - which will be used for this website. 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

If you want to use my code available in this public repository, here are the steps to follow when cloning the project:

## Requirements

- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)


## Install

```shell
npm install

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

cp .env .env.local # and replace "example.com" with your own backen URL/API
```

## Build

```shell
npm install
npm run build
```

### Eslint

[ESlint](https://eslint.org/) help you to find and fix problems in your JavaScript code.

You can launch eslint with :
```shell
npm run lint
```
